- Dictionary wise tagging and assigning scores
    * Create tag dictionaries:
    As of now, we will be tagging news articles only for following subjects.
    Create tag list for each of these subjects.
    - Politics
        - Contains list of all political parties, their supporters, leaders, etc.
        - These will be multiple lists such as -
        Congress = [Rahul, Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, congress, tharur, soniya]
        BJP = [Modi, Devendra, bjp, bhajapa, etc]
    - Crime
        - All the crime related words and their variations
    - Accidents

    * Given a news article, tag it based on the occurrences of tags. There will be multiple tags per news article.
      Identify the tag scores for each of the tags. Sort them based on descending order of the scores.
      These tag scores will be used in search runtime.
